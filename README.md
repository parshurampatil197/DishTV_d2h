# DishTV_d2h
Direct to home (D2H) operator DishTV wants you to design a mini software system for its customers.


Design a Dish TV service. 

Write a Django server which allows following:

1. allow users to sign up to d2h service
2. allow the user to login to the service
3. write an API to list all available channels on d2h. 
4. allow the user to select the channels.
5. write an API to get all the active channels
6. Once the user is created and he selects the channel, please send this information on kafka. Corresponding kafka consumers should write the message in file.

Please use Postgres as a backend database for the same. Design the database and write REST APIs for above.
